# Chrome-Sync
### Sync Browser and Phone

### The Idea

The idea of the project is to seamlessly continue your work from browser into mobile. 

Deep linking already allows us to open browser links into apps. 
But when you work on your computer and then you want to see the same content, but in mobile
it is burdensome to copy the link form the browser and open it on the phone. 

This project aims to solve that problem. 
Once you are done with computer it should be seamless to continue your app experience in your moblile. 

### This project
This is one part of the project. 
Second project should be done for Android. 

This project aims to send user URL's into unified server. 

### Current State
For now, our extension just detects URL. 
Next we need to send this URL based on Firebase, so that mobile device can get the data. 
The last task will be to make users authenticate, so that different users can use the applicaiton.  

### Future ideas
This project can be extended to multi user link share plaform. 
For example you are seeing one content on a page, you can send a link to your friend. 

By the way it should work on dynamic pages like Facebook. 
For example you saw a post on Facebook. 
You can try to share it to you friend by clicking post and searching for a share button. 

But what if you could click your chrome extension instead, and it would share correct URL 
based on what you are reading right now.
